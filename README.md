### Prerequisites
[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Whether your data is a simple Microsoft Excel workbook, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize (or discover) what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

### Download Power BI Desktop
You can download Power BI Desktop from the [web](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore) or as an app from the [Microsoft Store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521662) on the Windows tab.

### Sign in to Power BI service
Before you can sign in to Power BI, you'll need an account. To get a free trial, go to [app.powerbi.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2101313) and sign up with your email address.
